Administrator code
the Administrator forldier is made of four different files(.py) that are:
  - control
  - services
  - and dispatch
  
 Each parts are basically compose of classes that inherite the name of the file, feel free to take a look and leave suggestions.
 To simultaneously run all the part, do as said below:
  - save all the file(.py) in one folder (just like the 管理员 one)
  - use the import "method" to import all methods and classes used in that particular file.
